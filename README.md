# Showcase Project
A showcase of a group project. It includes text as data, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. Also includes a write up report presenting our project and findings.

The project was done using RStudio's R Markdown. Ive included the RMD file, HTML Output of the code, and the report in the form of PDF.

Feedback is always appriciated.
