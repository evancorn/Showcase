# Showcase Project
A showcase of a group project. It includes text as data, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. Also includes a write up report presenting our project and findings.

The project was done using RStudio's R Markdown. Ive included the RMD file, HTML Output of the code, and the report in the form of PDF.

Unfortunately the datasets used within the project are too large for Github, so if your interested in replicating our project you must email me at corneluis.epc@gmail.com and we can work something out. 

Feedback is always appriciated.
